# atom-tree-view-dblclick package for the Atom editor

By default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse/expand a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.

This package changes this by forcing the user to double-click on a files. Directories can be opened by double-clicking the directory name or single-clicking the little arrow next to the directory name, as is the default behavior in most editors.

## Install

```
apm install dbclick-tree-view
```

## Credit where credit is due
This package is heavily inspired by the [atom-double-click-tree-view](https://github.com/hszhsh/atom-double-click-tree-view)
and [atom-double-click-tree-view](https://github.com/mattsfrey/atom-double-click-tree-view)
packages. So a huge shout out to them.
